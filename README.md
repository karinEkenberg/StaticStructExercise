# Static Struct Exercise

This simple C# program demonstrates the use of a static struct named `Dogs`. The struct contains two static fields, `Breed` and `Height`, representing the breed and height of a dog, respectively.

## Code Overview

### Struct: `Dogs`

The struct `Dogs` has the following static fields:
- `Breed`: Represents the breed of the dog.
- `Height`: Represents the height of the dog in centimeters.

### Program

The `Program` class contains the `Main` method, which serves as the entry point for the application. In the `Main` method, the program prints the breed and size of the dog using the static fields of the `Dogs` struct.

## How to Run

1. Open the project in a C# development environment.
2. Build and run the program.

## Output

The program will output the following message:

```
The dog breed and size is:
The Akita are around 65 cm tall.
```

This indicates the breed and height of the dog based on the values stored in the `Dogs` struct.

Feel free to modify the code or experiment with different values in the struct to explore its behavior.
